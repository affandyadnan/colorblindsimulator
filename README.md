# ColorBlindSimulator

Color blindness simulator tool in Python, to manipulate images and simulate color vision deficiencies. A simple implementation of a color blindness simulator tool that takes an image as input and simulates how it would appear to users with different types of color vision deficiencies.

This code defines a function simulate_color_blindness() that takes an image path and a type of color blindness as input. It then loads the image, applies the transformation matrix corresponding to the selected type of color blindness, and generates a simulated image. Finally, it displays the simulated image.
